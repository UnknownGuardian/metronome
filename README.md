Rely on ticks instead of time.

## Ticks > Time

An unlimited amount of work can be done every tick. A tick will take exactly as long as the amount of work it has to do that tick.

Simulations can benefit from easier time modeling by using executing ticks as fast as possible, instead of waiting for a specific time.
